# Library

 This project is used for managing a library's data including clients
 and books. The program starts of by asking the user to choose between adding a 
 new client, adding a new book, borrowing a book, returning a book and listing the 
 information of the clients and books. The program then enters into a switch statement 
 which contains 8 cases that cover each of the choices. The program utillizes OOP (Object Orientated Programming)
 in order to create arraylists for each of the objects livre (book) and client. By manipulating 
 these arraylists in each of the switch cases the program simulates a library's database.
