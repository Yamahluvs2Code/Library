# Library

 This project is used for managing a library's data including the clients
 and books. The program starts of by asking the user to choose between adding a 
 new client, adding a new book, borrowing a book, returning a book and listing the 
 information of the clients and books. The program then enters into a switch statement 
 which contains 8 cases that cover each of the choices. The program utillizes OOP for
 object livre (book) and object client.
